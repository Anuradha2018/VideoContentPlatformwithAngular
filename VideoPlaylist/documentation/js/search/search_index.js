Angular\nThe Application code has two components : 1. Video-list: displays the list\n                             2. Video-detail: displays the details of each video\nHere are the steps to run the program: \n1.    Down the project from the repository,\n2.    Open the project on command-line : Run npm install,\n3.    Run ng serve,\n4.    The project gets loaded on localhost:4200.\nI addressed this requirements of the task in Angular:\nVideo Library List\n- No videos with active set to false should be shown: implemented \n- The list must be searchable (or filtered in-place) by simple plain text entry and match text at minimum in the video title. : implemented\n- Videos in the list must at minimum display the thumbnail, title and running time. But feel free to be creative: implemented\nVideo Detail\n- The detail page for a video should show the video’s title and description. : implemented\n- A video player should be included to play the video. react-hls or react-player (or any working HLS implementation of your choice):  Implemented with Videogular2\nDesign \n- The user experience does not need to be an impressive visual one, but we should be able to navigate the application effectively: It’s not an impressive UI, I can make it with bootstrap which I wanted but it was not the main focus I did not invest much time.\nOther important information:\n- Properties in the JSON beginning with base may be disregarded.\n- Videos are supposed to be in Spanish. : Taken into consideration and disregarded.\nThings we love to see:\n- Commit history: considered &implemented\n- Tests: implemented\n- README with instructions on how to run the application and explain any relevant design considerations.  : considered and done\nVideoPlaylist\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 6.2.3.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
